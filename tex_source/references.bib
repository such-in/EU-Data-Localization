abstract = {In the modern Web, service providers often rely heavily on third parties to run their services. For example, they make use of ad networks to finance their services, externally hosted libraries to develop features quickly, and analytics providers to gain insights into visitor behavior. For security and privacy, website owners need to be aware of the content they provide their users. However, in reality, they often do not know which third parties are embedded, for example, when these third parties request additional content as it is common in real-time ad auctions. In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study to analyze the magnitude of these new challenges. To better reflect the connectedness of third parties, we measured their relations in a model we call third party trees, which reflects an approximation of the loading dependencies of all third parties embedded into a given website. Using this concept, we show that including a single third party can lead to subsequent requests from up to eight additional services. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the third parties embedded on a page load are not always deterministic, as 50&nbsp;\% of the branches in the third party trees change between repeated visits. In addition, we found that 93&nbsp;\% of the analyzed websites embedded third parties that are located in regions that might not be in line with the current legal framework. Our study also replicates previous work that mostly focused on landing pages of websites. We show that this method is only able to measure a lower bound as subsites show a significant increase of privacy-invasive techniques. For example, our results show an increase of used cookies by about 36&nbsp;\% when crawling websites more deeply.},

abstract = {A tracking flow is a flow between an end user and a Web tracking service. We develop an extensive measurement methodology for quantifying at scale the amount of tracking flows that cross data protection borders, be it national or international, such as the EU28 border within which the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies. Our methodology uses a browser extension to fully render advertising and tracking code, various lists and heuristics to extract well known trackers, passive DNS replication to get all the IP ranges of trackers, and state-of-the art geolocation. We employ our methodology on a dataset from 350 real users of the browser extension over a period of more than four months, and then generalize our results by analyzing billions of web tracking flows from more than 60 million broadband and mobile users from 4 large European ISPs. We show that the majority of tracking flows cross national borders in Europe but, unlike popular belief, are pretty well confined within the larger GDPR jurisdiction. Simple DNS redirection and PoP mirroring can increase national confinement while sealing almost all tracking flows within Europe. Last, we show that cross boarder tracking is prevalent even in sensitive and hence protected data categories and groups including health, sexual orientation, minors, and others.},

abstract = {Business relationships between ASes in the Internet are typically confidential, yet knowledge of them is essential to understand many aspects of Internet structure, performance, dynamics, and evolution. We present a new algorithm to infer these relationships using BGP paths. Unlike previous approaches, our algorithm does not assume the presence (or seek to maximize the number) of valley-free paths, instead relying on three assumptions about the Internet's inter-domain structure: (1) an AS enters into a provider relationship to become globally reachable; and (2) there exists a peering clique of ASes at the top of the hierarchy, and (3) there is no cycle of p2c links. We assemble the largest source of validation data for AS-relationship inferences to date, validating 34.6% of our 126,082 c2p and p2p inferences to be 99.6% and 98.7% accurate, respectively. Using these inferred relationships, we evaluate three algorithms for inferring each AS's customer cone, defined as the set of ASes an AS can reach using customer links. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms for studying the rise and fall of large transit providers over the last fifteen years, including recent claims about the flattening of the AS-level topology and the decreasing influence of tier-1 ASes on the global Internet.},

In this paper, we study the characteristics and implications of infrastructure sharing by analyzing the long-haul fiber-optic network in the US. We start by using fiber maps provided by tier-1 ISPs and major cable providers to construct a map of the long-haul US fiber-optic infrastructure. We also rely on previously under-utilized data sources in the form of public records from federal, state, and municipal agencies to improve the fidelity of our map. We quantify the resulting map's connectivity characteristics and confirm a clear correspondence between long-haul fiber-optic, roadway, and railway infrastructures. Next, we examine the prevalence of high-risk links by mapping end-to-end paths resulting from large-scale traceroute campaigns onto our fiber-optic infrastructure map. We show how both risk and latency (i.e., propagation delay) can be reduced by deploying new links along previously unused transportation corridors and rights-of-way. In particular, focusing on a subset of high-risk links is sufficient to improve the overall robustness of the network to failures. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings on issues related to performance, net neutrality, and policy decision-making.},

abstract = {E-mail has long been a critical component of daily communication and the core medium for modern business correspondence. While traditionally e-mail service was provisioned and implemented independently by each Internet-connected organization, increasingly this function has been outsourced to third-party services. As with many pieces of key communications infrastructure, such centralization can bring both economies of scale and shared failure risk. In this paper, we investigate this issue empirically --- providing a large-scale measurement and analysis of modern Internet e-mail service provisioning. We develop a reliable methodology to better map domains to mail service providers. We then use this approach to document the dominant and increasing role played by a handful of mail service providers and hosting companies over the past four years. Finally, we briefly explore the extent to which nationality (and hence legal jurisdiction) plays a role in such mail provisioning decisions.},

abstract = {Evaluating and characterizing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is critical to subscribers shopping for alternative ISPs, companies providing reliable Internet services, and governments surveying the coverage of broadband services to its citizens. Ideally, ISP characterization should be done at scale, continuously, and from end users. While there has been significant progress toward this end, current approaches exhibit apparently unavoidable tradeoffs between coverage, continuous monitoring and capturing user-perceived performance.In this paper, we argue that network-intensive applications running on end systems avoid these tradeoffs, thereby offering an ideal platform for ISP characterization. Based on data collected from 500,000 peer-to-peer BitTorrent users across 3,150 networks, together with the reported results from the U.K. Ofcom/SamKnows studies, we show the feasibility of this approach to characterize the service that subscribers can expect from a particular ISP. We discuss remaining research challenges and design requirements for a solution that enables efficient and accurate ISP characterization at an Internet scale.},

abstract = {Measuring reliability of edge networks in the Internet is difficult due to the size and heterogeneity of networks, the rarity of outages, and the difficulty of finding vantage points that can accurately capture such events at scale. In this paper, we use logs from a major CDN, detailing hourly request counts from address blocks. We discovered that in many edge address blocks, devices, collectively, contact the CDN every hour over weeks and months. We establish that a sudden temporary absence of these requests indicates a loss of Internet connectivity of those address blocks, events we call disruptions.We develop a disruption detection technique and present broad and detailed statistics on 1.5M disruption events over the course of a year. Our approach reveals that disruptions do not necessarily reflect actual service outages, but can be the result of prefix migrations. Major natural disasters are clearly represented in our data as expected; however, a large share of detected disruptions correlate well with planned human intervention during scheduled maintenance intervals, and are thus unlikely to be caused by external factors. Cross-evaluating our results we find that current state-of-the-art active outage detection over-estimates the occurrence of disruptions in some address blocks. Our observations of disruptions, service outages, and different causes for such events yield implications for the design of outage detection systems, as well as for policymakers seeking to establish reporting requirements for Internet services.},

abstract="Almost all popular Internet services are hosted in a select set of countries, forcing other nations to rely on international connectivity to access them. We identify nations where traffic towards a large portion of the country is serviced by a small number of Autonomous Systems, and, therefore, may be exposed to observation or selective tampering by these ASes. We introduce the Country-level Transit Influence (CTI) metric to quantify the significance of a given AS on the international transit service of a particular country. By studying the CTI values for the top ASes in each country, we find that 34 nations have transit ecosystems that render them particularly exposed, where a single AS is privy to traffic destined to over 40{\%} of their IP addresses. In the nations where we are able to validate our findings with in-country operators, our top-five ASes are 90{\%} accurate on average. In the countries we examine, CTI reveals two classes of networks frequently play a particularly prominent role: submarine cable operators and state-owned ASes.",

abstract = {The growing demand for an ever-increasing number of cloud services is profoundly transforming the Internet's interconnection or peering ecosystem, and one example is the emergence of "virtual private interconnections (VPIs)". However, due to the underlying technologies, these VPIs are not publicly visible and traffic traversing them remains largely hidden as it bypasses the public Internet. In particular, existing techniques for inferring Internet interconnections are unable to detect these VPIs and are also incapable of mapping them to the physical facility or geographic region where they are established.In this paper, we present a third-party measurement study aimed at revealing all the peerings between Amazon and the rest of the Internet. We describe our technique for inferring these peering links and pay special attention to inferring the VPIs associated with this largest cloud provider. We also present and evaluate a new method for pinning (i.e., geo-locating) each end of the inferred interconnections or peering links. Our study provides a first look at Amazon's peering fabric. In particular, by grouping Amazon's peerings based on their key features, we illustrate the specific role that each group plays in how Amazon peers with other networks.},

Policymakers, ISPs, and users are increasingly interested in studying the performance of Internet access links. Because of many confounding factors in a home network or on end hosts, however, thoroughly understanding access network performance requires deploying measurement infrastructure in users' homes as gateway devices. In conjunction with the Federal Communication Commission's study of broadband Internet access in the United States, we study the throughput and latency of network access links using longitudinal measurements from nearly 4,000 gateway devices across 8 ISPs from a deployment of over 4,200 devices. We study the performance users achieve and how various factors ranging from the user's choice of modem to the ISP's traffic shaping policies can affect performance. Our study yields many important findings about the characteristics of existing access networks. Our findings also provide insights into the ways that access network performance should be measured and presented to users, which can help inform ongoing broader efforts to benchmark the performance of access networks.},

Automated web page classifiers have many applications, and many researchers have proposed techniques and tools to perform web page classification. Unfortunately, the existing tools have a number of drawbacks that makes them unappealing for real-world scenarios, namely: they require a previous extensive crawling, they are supervised, they need to download a page before classifying it, or they are site-, language-, or domain-dependent. In this article, we propose CALA, a tool for URL-based web page classification. The strongest features of our tool are that it does not require a previous extensive crawling to achieve good classification results, it is unsupervised, it is based exclusively on URL features, which means that pages can be classified without downloading them, and it is site-, language-, and domain-independent, which makes it generally applicable. We have validated our tool with 22 real-world web sites from multiple domains and languages, and our conclusion is that CALA is very effective and efficient in practice.}

Usually, web pages are classified using their content, but a URL-only classifier is preferable, (i) when speed is crucial, (ii) to enable content filtering before an (objection-able) web page is downloaded, (iii) when a page's content is hidden in images, (iv) to annotate hyperlinks in a personalized web browser, without fetching the target page, and (v) when a focused crawler wants to infer the topic of a target page before devoting bandwidth to download it. We apply a machine learning approach to the topic identification task and evaluate its performance in extensive experiments on categorized web pages from the Open Directory Project (ODP). When training separate binary classifiers for each topic, we achieve typical F-measure values between 80 and 85, and a typical precision of around 85. We also ran experiments on a small data set of university web pages. For the task of classifying these pages into faculty, student, course and project pages, our methods improve over previous approaches by 13.8 points of F-measure.},

The anonymous user browsing traffic and device preferences create unique failure patterns that reveal where connectivity is not well-served by standard networking technology. Geographical and cultural marginalization has lead to distinctive Internet usage when connectivity is available. For instance, residents commonly visit websites that are not as popular in the wider United States; and mobile devices dominate web request traffic, often with content-heavy video and media downloads, despite sustaining a higher rate of failure than desktop devices. This statistical analysis of passive measurements avoids institutional and cultural biases and ensures continuing research will contribute to a decolonizing narrative of Native American informational practices and values. Based on our analysis, we propose follow-up research angles to better understand the technological and social drivers behind these findings in order to improve user experience in this, and similar, networks.},

    abstract = { The author investigates how high-speed home Internet use has affected labor supply. Using an instrumental variables strategy that exploits cross-state variation in supply-side constraints to residential broadband Internet access, she finds that exogenously determined high-speed Internet use leads to a 4.1 percentage point increase in labor force participation for married women. No corresponding effect is found for single women or men. Among married women, the largest increases in participation are found among college-educated women with children. Supplemental analyses suggest that Internet use for telework and saving time in home production explains the increase in participation. The results suggest that home Internet facilitates work-family balance. }

abstract = {There is significant interest in the technical and policy communities regarding the extent, scope, and consumer harm of persistent interdomain congestion. We provide empirical grounding for discussions of interdomain congestion by developing a system and method to measure congestion on thousands of interdomain links without direct access to them. We implement a system based on the Time Series Latency Probes (TSLP) technique that identifies links with evidence of recurring congestion suggestive of an under-provisioned link. We deploy our system at 86 vantage points worldwide and show that congestion inferred using our lightweight TSLP method correlates with other metrics of interconnection performance impairment. We use our method to study interdomain links of eight large U.S. broadband access providers from March 2016 to December 2017, and validate our inferences against ground-truth traffic statistics from two of the providers. For the period of time over which we gathered measurements, we did not find evidence of widespread endemic congestion on interdomain links between access ISPs and directly connected transit and content providers, although some such links exhibited recurring congestion patterns. We describe limitations, open challenges, and a path toward the use of this method for large-scale third-party monitoring of the Internet interconnection ecosystem.},

has been well studied over the last few years. However, far less is known about the
role IXPs play as a platform to enable large-scale content delivery and to reach a
world-wide customer base. In this paper, we study the infrastructure deployment of
a content hypergiant, Netflix, and show that the combined worldwide IXP substrate
is the major corner stone of its Content Delivery Network. This highlights the additional
role that IXPs play in the Internet ecosystem, not just in terms of interconnection,
but also allowing players such as Netflix to deliver significant amounts of traffic.},

abstract = {We present Topology-based Geolocation (TBG), a novel approach to estimating the geographic location of arbitrary Internet hosts. We motivate our work by showing that 1) existing approaches, based on end-to-end delay measurements from a set of landmarks, fail to outperform much simpler techniques, and 2) the error of these approaches is strongly determined by the distance to the nearest landmark, even when triangulation is used to combine estimates from different landmarks. Our approach improves on these earlier techniques by leveraging network topology, along with measurements of network delay, to constrain host position. We convert topology and delay data into a set of constraints, then solve for router and host locations simultaneously. This approach improves the consistency of location estimates, reducing the error substantially for structured networks in our experiments on Abilene and Sprint. For networks with insufficient structural constraints, our techniques integrate external hints that are validated using measurements before being trusted. Together, these techniques lower the median estimation error for our university-based dataset to 67 km vs. 228 km for the best previous approach.},

abstract = {Content Hypergiants deliver the vast majority of Internet traffic to end users. In recent years, some have invested heavily in deploying services and servers inside end-user networks. With several dozen Hypergiants and thousands of servers deployed inside networks, these off-net (meaning outside the Hypergiant networks) deployments change the structure of the Internet. Previous efforts to study them have relied on proprietary data or specialized per-Hypergiant measurement techniques that neither scale nor generalize, providing a limited view of content delivery on today's Internet.In this paper, we develop a generic and easy to implement methodology to measure the expansion of Hypergiants' off-nets. Our key observation is that Hypergiants increasingly encrypt their traffic to protect their customers' privacy. Thus, we can analyze publicly available Internet-wide scans of port 443 and retrieve TLS certificates to discover which IP addresses host Hypergiant certificates in order to infer the networks hosting off-nets for the corresponding Hypergiants. Our results show that the number of networks hosting Hypergiant off-nets has tripled from 2013 to 2021, reaching 4.5k networks. The largest Hypergiants dominate these deployments, with almost all of these networks hosting an off-net for at least one -- and increasingly two or more -- of Google, Netflix, Facebook, or Akamai. These four Hypergiants have off-nets within networks that provide access to a significant fraction of end user population.},

abstract = {To enhance web browsing experiences, content distribution networks (CDNs) move web content "closer" to clients by caching copies of web objects on thousands of servers worldwide. Additionally, to minimize client download times, such systems perform extensive network and server measurements, and use them to redirect clients to different servers over short time scales. In this paper, we explore techniques for inferring and exploiting network measurements performed by the largest CDN, Akamai; our objective is to locate and utilize quality Internet paths without performing extensive path probing or monitoring.Our contributions are threefold. First, we conduct a broad measurement study of Akamai's CDN. We probe Akamai's network from 140 PlanetLab vantage points for two months. We find that Akamai redirection times, while slightly higher than advertised, are sufficiently low to be useful for network control. Second, we empirically show that Akamai redirections overwhelmingly correlate with network latencies on the paths between clients and the Akamai servers. Finally, we illustrate how large-scale overlay networks can exploit Akamai redirections to identify the best detouring nodes for one-hop source routing. Our research shows that in more than 50\% of investigated scenarios, it is better to route through the nodes "recommended" by Akamai, than to use the direct paths. Because this is not the case for the rest of the scenarios, we develop lowoverhead pruning algorithms that avoid Akamai-driven paths when they are not beneficial.},
